## 🤖 About the Game

AI Space Shooter is an AI-themed space shooter where you protect your neural network from adversarial attacks. As the defender of your AI model, you must shoot down enemy algorithms trying to corrupt your data and maintain your model's integrity.

This game was created using p5.js for the game engine and Supabase for the leaderboard and user data collection functionality.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- **Move**: Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move your neural defender
- **Shoot**: Press SPACEBAR to fire data packets at adversarial algorithms
- **Power-ups**: Collect special AI model enhancements:
  - **GPT**: Triple shot capability
  - **BERT**: Shield protection
  - **DALL-E**: Clear screen of all enemies

## 📊 Scoring System

- Each enemy destroyed: +10 points
- Power-up bonus (DALL-E): +50 points
- Game ends when:
  - You lose all 3 lives from enemy collisions
  - You lose all 3 lives from enemy bullets
  - You miss too many enemies (every 3 missed enemies costs 1 life)
